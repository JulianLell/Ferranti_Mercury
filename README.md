# Ferranti_Mercury
Building an emulator for the Ferranti Mercury in Python 3

This is an emulator for the mainframe computer Ferranti Mercury, created in England circa 1956. This code has been developed entirely with Python 3.

So far, most instructions are implemented, and the machine is able to run original code from the "Input Routine" (data transfers from/to "magnetic core main memory" to/from "magnetic drum storage".
